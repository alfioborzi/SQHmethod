The Sequential Quadratic Hamiltonian Method 

Solving Optimal Control Problems

1th Edition, CRC Press, 2023.

## DESCRIPTION

The sequential quadratic hamiltonian (SQH) method is a novel numerical optimization procedure for 
solving optimal control problems governed by differential models. It is based on the characterisation 
of optimal controls in the framework of the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP).

The SQH method is a powerful computational methodology that is capable of development in many directions. 
The book discusses its analysis and use in solving nonsmooth ODE control problems, relaxed ODE control 
problems, stochastic control problems, mixed-integer control problems, PDE control problems, inverse PDE problems, 
differential Nash game problems, and problems related to residual neural networks.

This book may serve as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, and as an introduction for researchers 
in sciences and engineering who intend to further develop the SQH method or wish to use it as a numerical tool 
for solving challenging optimal control problems and for investigating the Pontryagin maximum principle 
on new optimisation problems.

The book is accompanied by codes which allow the reader to apply the SQH method to solve 
many different optimal control and optimisation problems.
